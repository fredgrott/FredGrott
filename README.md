<!-- 1. headers should always have beg images
     2. Small paragraphs of 2 to 3 sentences
     3. Stylize the words to assist and enlist chunking.
     4. The About should be concise CV
     5. Use feeling and pain-a-picture words instead of academic words
     6. Since this is a git porfile readme never list your popular git repos as github, gitlab, and bitbucket wil do that automatically for your profile page added headers. Instead list your git cloud repos is more than one.
     7. Refrain from adding collapsible content as your git repo profile page is not suppose to be that lengthy long and boring.
     8. Put a 1-2-sentence summary of your personal manifesto in the About block as a blockquote.

     Note: md processors can process liquid tags so I need to play with liquid tags and see what I can use.
