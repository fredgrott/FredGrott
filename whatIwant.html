    <div class="content-section-a">

        <div class="container">

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-5 col-sm-6">
                    <hr class="section-heading-spacer">
                    <div class="clearfix"></div>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">What I Want</h2>
                    <p class="lead">While, those firms that contract out 
                    	for specific developer services somewhat know what 
                    	android application they are building and the 
                    	android application skills required it seems that 
                    	startups as far as top managment tend to not 
                    	take the time to find out and are asking blind.</p>
                    	<p>Thus, this a polite helpful way of stating get an effing clue.
                    		Specifically you want a mobile applications engineer that 
                    		has a good background in java and agile. How do you tell?
                    		</p>
                    		<p>Specifically, right now with Google spear-heading a change from the 
                    			Ant build system to Gradle certain tools have failed to catch up such 
                    			as Continuous Integration Servers, CodeQA coverage Servers, and 
                    			Test Runner Servers. The specific obstacle is that Gradle introduced 
                    			concepts of native binary, product and flavor but their not fully 
                    			implemented yet and thus Google came up with their own implementation of 
                    			that and android sourcesets as a placeholder.</p>
                    			<p>Thus, I the mobile applications engineer, have determined if I start doing a 
                    				new implementation of codeqa tasks and module/project dashboards within
                    				the project build scripts that I can eventually once that is complete 
                    				eventually use similar techniques and tool fill out rest of the tools 
                    				with my android specific implementatyions so that I do not have to wait as the 
                    				underlying obstacle described above with it not fully implemented the 
                    				gradle way in the gradle sdk will be that way for about 18 to 24 months.</p>
                    				<p>And yes, I am fully aware that given the market size of the android development 
                    					tools and services market which is about 500 billion that I could in fact 
                    					build a start focusing on that window opportunity. Thus, in engaging in 
                    					communication with me you are not dealign with a beginning or intemediate developer.
                    					</p>
                    					<p>Your CTO/Engineer would love to find some mobile applications engineer that is 
                    						taking it upon themselves to determine which problems need to be solved now and 
                    						in the future and coming up with a mission and objectives of that mission and 
                    						executing on them. So how do you get me?</p>
                    						<p>First, you have to determine if you want me. The talk to figure out if you want me is not 
                    							working as there is 50 plus entities asking per week. Ever hear that Blue Brother line 
                    							of 'I am on a mission from God'? Well, after I complete the beginning of the codeqa 
                    							tool I am than proceeding to implement an AUT/FSM tool(its automating testing of the UI components) 
                    							and along the way I am determining the how to write the CS MS/PhD level journal papers and will 
                    							be completing the process of getting them published. So you can see that 
                    							if all the 50 entities per week are attmepting to talk to me with none of them determining 
                    							if they want me that will just not work as far as time constraints, etc.</p>
                    							<p>Now, we come down to what I might want. Because of a startup directly lying about 
                    								having competed the seed capital collection phase, I lost potential project 
                    								contract payments that was going to be used to buy specific equipment and 
                    								relocate me to Lake county Indiana so that I would only be 25 minutes from 
                    								downtown via South Shore.</p>
                    								<p>I have to work 26 weeks at a certain  1099 weekly fee, paid weekly, to 
                    									finance the equipment purchases I need to make and to finance the relocation to 
                    									Lake county Indiana. Thus, the requirement to work remotely and under weekly 
                    									1099 is somewhat temporary and it will result in a relocation that will 
                    									allow me to work-on-site in Chicago as most of the Chicago loccations will 
                    									be reachable through the SouthShore and Metra combinations with travel times 
                    									ranging from 25 to 56 minutes.</p>
                    									<p>And yes, there are those of you reading this that upon hearing that may 
                    										choose to say we are not a fit beccause of the temporary 1099 
                    										remote requirement. That is okay, because if we are not a fit than 
                    										we are not a fit and beside you will be kicking yoruself in 12 months 
                    										wishing you had said yes anyway. The entity that says yes, will of course 
                    										will be dancing-in-the-streets.</p>
                    										<p>For those of you that may have decided that you might want to consider 
                    											granting the 26-weeks developing-remotely at a 1099 rate temporary terms to get a more 
                    											pernament full-time solution it is far easier for me to insist that 
                    											you make a commitment to travel to my location to proceed with a 
                    											discussion as I want to show you some immediate stuff that I am working on 
                    											as part of the discussion as its not building tools just to build tools as 
                    											they are getting used to build applications. For most of you  will 
                    											not be much of travel commitment because the place we will meet at is 
                    											only 45 minutes from downtown Chicago.</p>
                    											<p>Concluding, yes it is a bit long. But, we need things focused on the 
                    												missions and tasks of both you and myself so both get what we want.</p>
