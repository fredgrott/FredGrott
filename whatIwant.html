                    <h2 class="section-heading">What I Want</h2>
                    <p class="lead">While, those firms that contract out 
                    	for specific developer services somewhat know what 
                    	android application they are building and the 
                    	android application skills required it seems that 
                    	startups as far as top managment tend to not 
                    	take the time to find out and are asking blind.</p>
                    	<p>Thus, this a polite helpful way of stating get an effing clue.
                    		Specifically you want a mobile applications engineer that 
                    		has a good background in java and agile. How do you tell?
                    		</p>
                    		
                    		<p>Or better yet how can you find a mobile android java applications engineer?
                    			You could try the HR way in which most recruiters follow. You will notice 
                    			that the big companies are not doing that they are in fact acquiring companies to 
                    			buy engineers.</p>
                    			<p>But not every startup can buy companies to buy enginners. Paul Graham, inventor of the 
                    				web 1.0 application, states that we have ashortage of software enginners in the USA 
                    				as part of his points on why we need more immigration into the USA. But, recruiting 
                    				outside the USA is not fro every startup either.</p>
                    				<p>What if instead of this random oh I have a startup and so I need developers type 
                    					of flopping-around you instead focused on something central and common to good 
                    					Android Java Application Enginners.</p>
                    					<p>The followers and advocates of Shewhart understand Data is composed of two parts;
                    						one part noise and one part non-noise for thosee observable systems in wich we have 
                    						the controlling of processes whereas one component might happen to be natural and 
                    						one component might be human. But how do you tell noise from non-noise?</p>
                    						<p>Robolectric is a tool certain ignorants want to believe in and live by in 
                    							their development process within Android Java Application development. The problem 
                    							lies in the fact that any feedback from  unit tests beyond the domain or business logic classes
                    							within a memory-and-cpu-constrained device user-interface intensive mobile application is 
                    							somewhat noise. And yet the startup producing that tool got funding based on some wrong premises like that tool.</p>
                    							
                    							<p>The PhD level thesis that I am pursuing in the creation of tools and than data 
                    								collection,etc is simply that when the application's Ui is 80% fo the application 
                    								as in mobile that we have certain concerns in which require different testing 
                    								strategies to separate out the noise from the useful data. The TDD approach of 
                    								treating tyhe UI the same as business logic classes is a fool-hardy proposition that 
                    								leads many mobile developers astray.</p>
                    								
                    							<p>Due to Google's switch to using gradle instead of ant as the build tool certain 
                    								main-stream commercial tools are somewhat behind in the understanding of 
                    								android gradle product flavors as it pertains to code-quality data collectiion statistics 
                    								on the code-base, the right testing process for the right testing concern, etc.
                    								And certainly, as I develop new tools to correct these certain problem areas I 
                    								could in fact develop a startup around such solutions.</p>
                    								
                    								<p>Remember, Google Keywords are SEo noisy when we deal with context. Because, the AI Google is 
                    									in the process of implementing one baby step at a time is not yet at the point where context of 
                    									human languages is understood by a computer. That means if you add two SEO situations together 
                    									the recruiter SEo keyword search alogn with anon-technical person doing an interview, ie the 
                    									normal recruiter, you end up with a dismal way fo picking an enginner. Do you want 
                    									something bettter that process?</p>
                    									
                    									<p>Sit down your CTO ask him or her for a counter to my thesis that a mobile application in 
                    										which usually there is 80% of code as the UI has two distinct testing conern areas that 
                    										have to be handled differrently in both testing approaches and code implementation and design 
                    										approaches. Now when the coutner thesis is offered ask for data to back up that counter thesis.
                    										I can bet you your CTO will never find data to back pu theri counter theis, do you know why?</p>
                    										
                    										<p>Okay a little agile and computer history background. Okay the moeny computation cost amount 
                    											per hour use to be high for computer machinery and low for human programmers way 
                    											back in the 1940s and 1950s. the other trend was that the User Interface code as 
                    											a percentage was smaller than the percentage of code pertaining to the business 
                    											logic classes.</p>
                    											<p>At places like IBM,etc they came up with development process of waterfall. 
                    												You wrote a specification-in-stone not-to-be-changed and than would habve this 
                    												long drawn out process of development because the human hours were lower in cost per hour than the 
                    												computing hour costs. There was no incentive to change as in enterprise the user are not 
                    												the dictators of change and the cost structure was such that saving human developer hours would not 
                    												statistically impact totoal project costs at all.</p>
                    												<p>That all changed when we got faster CPUs and faster data storage units in that now the costs
                    													per hour for code development is higher than the operation costs per hour of that computing device.
                    													Than they came up with things like TDD to get into having a process that would try and discover
                    													 the code -product variations that would be most likely in the process of eliminating them to produce 
                    													 a steady state fot he system composed opf the devloping application and the devlopers whereas the 
                    													 development goes at a fast clip to a successful finish.</p>
                    													 <p>The problem is unit testing is not the contextof the code-base its SEO-like in that it only 
                    													 	indicates keyword-like value of the individual coding units. It will not have any contextual value 
                    													 	implied by any unit test data unless the developer separates the code-base into business logic classes 
                    													 	and UI classes, and only than if the developer only applies TDD unit testing to the business logic classes.</p>
                    													 	<p>This is the underlying problem in all Agile process in that they ignore the underlying different contexts 
                    													 		of the different areas of a typical application. The other trend involved in pointing to 
                    													 		a miss-application of agile has to do with the imnpact of applications being used by millsions and 
                    													 		billions as opposed to a few hundred and thousands in the 1940s and 1950s. Now, ew haev the 
                    													 		quality of the UI as a factor in gaining market share not to mention all the UI potimization we do on 
                    													 		mobile to deal with memory and cpu limiation constraints.</p>
                    													 		<p>Compare Mobile to Enterprise and Web applications much you would compare a great Poem, PLay, and Novel.
                    													 			You specifcally combine gammar, syntax, and context in specfic implementations ina poem that 
                    													 			are differnt than in a Play or a Novel. This is the same for Mobile in that it is vastly different 
                    													 			application of code development grammar, syntax, and context than enterpise or applications devloped int he distnat past of 
                    													 			software development. This is why youor CTO will not find data to counter my thesis because the trends and their basis in 
                    													 			software development and computer development history is against the CTO's own counter thesis.</p>
                    													 			<p>The other point of debate, other than you may be seeking an android java application engineer in the wrong manner that 
                    													 				does not subtract noise from non-noise, is that due to a startup cheating me out of 
                    													 				cash revenues of $16,000 due to lying about acquiring seed capital I am out of savings and 
                    													 				have to work remote at freelance rates for 28 weeks(padi weekly) to finance equipment purchases and a 
                    													 				relocation to Lake County Indiana so that most Chicago locations are only 25 to 55 minutes 
                    													 				via SouthShore and Metra travel combinations and its even 55 minutes to Evanston.</p>
                    													 				<p>I do not expect every startup to be able to grant such a temporary arrangement in order to get 
                    													 					a full-time android java application enginner as an employee after the temporary 28 week 
                    													 					remote period. But, there are certain startups at certain stages whereas the benefits of gaining 
                    													 					some of what I have outlined about is to their distinct advantage.</p>
                    													 					<p>Obviously, I am only talking to the startups in the latter category as I have to separate noise from non-noise.
                    													 					And obviously a talk covering such things really cannot be by phone as it should if you are 
                    													 					really a startup interested in obtaining my skill-set at my  location say at the subway near 
                    													 					the public library with you buying the meal. Besides, should you not see what I am building actually running?
                    													 					Yes, you should. For most Chicago startups, the public library I do code development as using their wifi 
                    													 					is about 45 minutes from downtown Chicago via I94 or I80/I90.</p>
                    													 					<p>The courageous startup that chooses to meet with me and grant the temporary 28-week at freelance rates(paid weekly) remotely 
                    													 						will recieve these benefits:
                    													 						<ul>
                    													 							<li>Full knowledge of how the android SDK components work together and are 
                    													 								built together so that can at times re-use those implementations in 
                    													 								code development workflow optimizations.</li>
                    													 							<li>Full knowledge of the Agile processes and their blind spots as it pertains to 
                    													 								mobile android java application development. I am even full immersed in developing 
                    													 								a new one specific to android.</li>
                    													 							<li>Full knowledge of parts of java were included in android java and which java parts were not.
                    													 								For example, java beans was not fully included and that means that making Groovy android 
                    													 								capable will take longer than everyone states.</li>
                    													 							<li>Full knowledge of the benefits and disadvantages of using every java pattern and 
                    													 								every java anti-pattern.</li>
                    													 							<li>Full knowledge of the mobile android hardware stack and the android OS stack and how they 
                    													 								work together which is helpful in determining which memory and CPU use ooptimization strategies 
                    													 								will more likely work rather than just blind guessing.</li>
                    													 							<li>And of course the full tools and libraries that I use(consult your CTO for more direct meanings);
                    													 								Agile TDD, Agile BDD, Agile Black box functional testing, RxJava, Otto event Bus, 
                    													 								Okhttp instead of volley, Dagger Dependency Injection, Butterknife view Injection, Hamcrest 
                    													 								Matchers, Junit 3 and Junit 4, AssertJ, Appcompatv7, Cardview, Recyclerview, Palette, Git, 
                    													 								Android Studio, XML/XSLT, Gradle, Groovy, Griffon, SQLite, and countless others not 
                    													 								mentioned.</li>
